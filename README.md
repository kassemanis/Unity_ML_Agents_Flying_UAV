# Flying Drone Using Unity ML-Agents

This project involves training a flying drone to navigate a virtual environment using Unity and the ML-Agents toolkit. Specifically, the drone must learn to dodge trees and reach a predetermined goal.

## Demo

Here is a demo of the flying drone in action:

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3.7.9 and PyTorch 1.13.1 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the ML-Agents toolkit version 0.28.0, which can be done using the instructions provided in the official documentation.

Once you have Python, PyTorch, and ML-Agents installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in Unity to begin working with the drone.

## Training the Drone

To train the drone, you will need to define a reward function that incentivizes the drone to avoid trees and reach the goal. You can then use the ML-Agents toolkit to train the drone using reinforcement learning.

The trained model can then be used to test the drone's ability to navigate the environment and complete the task.
